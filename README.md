# Telecom User Overview and Engagement Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze user behavior and engagement in the telecom sector. By understanding handset popularity, session metrics, and engagement levels, we can provide insights to improve Quality of Service (QoS) and inform marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on:
- Handset types and manufacturers
- Session duration and frequency
- Data usage (download and upload)

## Analysis Tasks

### Task 1: User Overview Analysis

- **Top 10 Handsets**: Identify the most popular devices among users.
- **Top 3 Manufacturers**: Determine the leading handset manufacturers.
- **Session Duration and Data Usage**: Explore patterns in how users interact with their devices.

### Task 2: User Engagement Analysis

- **Engagement Metrics**: Calculate session frequency, duration, and total traffic to assess user engagement.
- **High Engagement Users**: Identify users with the highest engagement levels.

## Key Insights

- **Device Popularity**: Apple devices are the most popular, followed by Huawei and Samsung.
- **User Engagement**: Most users have low session frequencies, with a few highly engaged users showing frequent activity.

## Recommendations

- **Optimize Network Resources**: Focus on areas with high engagement.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Leverage insights on handset popularity and user engagement.
- **Service Bundling**: Consider app usage patterns for bundled offerings.
